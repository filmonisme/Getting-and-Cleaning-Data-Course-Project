#Getting and Cleanding Data Course Project

Experiments have been carried out on a group of 30 people using a smartphone. The sensor signals (accelerometer
and gyroscope) were collected and preprocessed. The data was divided into training (70%) and test data(30%)

## The R script called run_analysis.R does the following. 

    *Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    *Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    *Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    *Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    *An independent tidy data set is created from step 4 with the average of each variable  for each activity and each subject.
